# CodeTracer — how it works

A guide to the internals: what happens between your command and the output, and why it's
built this way. For usage see `README.md`; for the command-prep agent see `AGENT.md`.

## Guiding principle: Roslyn is the source of truth, the model is secondary

The codebase is large, old, and runs on a GPU-less VDI with a small local model
(`gemma4:latest`). Small models on CPU are **weak at autonomous navigation** but
**good at explaining code they are handed**. So the design splits responsibilities:

- **Roslyn** (`MSBuildWorkspace`) does everything that must be *correct*: resolving symbols,
  finding callers/callees, computing the call graph, the shortest path. These are exact,
  not guessed.
- **The model** only does what it's good at: turning a precisely-prepared chunk of code into
  a readable explanation, and (in trace) picking which tool to call next.

Every place where the model could produce something wrong is backed by a deterministic
Roslyn result. That's the whole architecture in one sentence.

## Components

| file | responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Program.cs` | parse args, pick the command (`explain`/`trace`), load the solution, wire things up |
| `AutoRouter.cs` | before any MSBuild loads: detect classic/mixed solutions and re-launch the net472 build |
| `Compat/Shims.cs` | net8.0 ↔ net472 source compatibility (BCL methods missing on .NET Framework) |
| `RoslynIndex.cs` | all Roslyn analysis: symbols, callers, callees, `find_path`, `BuildMethodContext` |
| `LlmClient.cs` | HTTP to Ollama `/api/chat` (structured outputs) or an OpenAI-compatible server |
| `Agent.cs` | trace mode: deterministic pre-flight, the model loop, JSON enforcement, escalation |
| `Explainer.cs` | explain mode: per-method prompts, deep call-chain walk + end-to-end synthesis |
| `Diagram.cs` | the `## Call-flow` diagram (ASCII + Mermaid) of what the analysis found — deterministic |

Startup detail: `MSBuildLocator.RegisterDefaults()` must run **before** any Roslyn/MSBuild
type is touched, so all real work lives in methods, not inline in `Program.cs`. Even earlier,
`AutoRouter.Route()` runs first (it touches no MSBuild type): on the .NET (Core) build it inspects
the `.sln`, and if any project is classic (non-SDK) it re-execs the **net472** build — whose
`RegisterDefaults()` then picks the **full Visual Studio MSBuild** that can load Framework projects.
The net8.0 build's SDK MSBuild can't, which is the whole reason for the two targets.

## `explain` mode — pipeline

```
--method "C.M"  ─┐
                 ├─► RoslynIndex.BuildMethodContext ──► MethodContext ──► Explainer ──► Ollama ──► text
--file + --line ─┘        (extract ONLY the method)        (compact)       (prompt)    (1 call)
```

### 1. Roslyn builds a *compact* context (never the whole file)
`BuildMethodContext` resolves the method to an `IMethodSymbol` and extracts only:
- the **signature** + **full body** of that method,
- **parameters** and their types,
- **fields/properties read vs. written** (it walks the body, classifies each member access
  as a write if it's the left side of an assignment, `ref`/`out` arg, or `++`/`--`),
- **callees** — methods it calls, with signature + where they're declared,
- the **doc comment**, if any.

This is why a 5000-line class is no problem: the model sees one method, never the file.

### 2. The model explains it
- **`--depth 0`** → one unconstrained call (`format` = null), free text. Fast.
- **`--depth N ≥ 1`** → **deep, layer by layer**. Roslyn walks the **call chain** from the
  entry method down through its in-solution callees (BFS to depth `N`, capped by
  `--max-methods`, default 8). **Each method is explained in its own call** with its full
  body (not a truncated snippet), then a final **end-to-end synthesis** describes how it all
  flows together. So `N+1` model calls — deeper depth/`--max-methods` = more thorough on
  non-trivial code. This is the fix for "depth went shallow": depth now drives a real
  per-method walk, not one summarising pass.

Knobs: `--num-predict` (output cap, default 4096; chain nodes get a smaller per-node budget,
the synthesis gets the full cap), `--temperature` (default 0.2).

### 3. Special cases
- **Properties:** `--method "Class.Property"` resolves a property/indexer and explains its
  get/set accessor bodies (reads/writes, callees, callers) — same pipeline as a method.
- **`--question "…"`** is placed *first* in the task, so it's answered even if the output is
  truncated by `num_predict`.
- **`--goal "…"`** (change proposal) is a **separate** call, so a long explanation can't eat
  its token budget. Output gets a `## Change proposal` section.
- **Long methods (> 400 lines)** are split into top-level **blocks** (~120 lines each),
  explained block-by-block, then a final summary call stitches it together.
- Every explanation ends with an **`## In plain words`** recap — a cheap second pass that
  re-states it for a 10-year-old (plain words, no jargon).
- …and then a **`## Call-flow`** diagram (see below): the call-tree the explanation walked, so
  the reader sees the whole shape at a glance. Deterministic — no extra model call.
- The output always starts with a self-describing header (method, location, signature) so a
  saved `.md` makes sense on its own.

## `trace` mode — pipeline

```
-f target.cs ─┐                                  ┌─ pre-flight: find_path over pairs ─► PATH FOUND? ─► print, done
-e endpoint ──┤─► Bootstrap (candidate pairs) ──►┤
              │                                   └─ else (and not --no-llm): model loop ─► find_path/… ─► finish
              ▼
        RoslynIndex.find_path = BFS over CALLERS (deterministic shortest path)
```

### 1. Bootstrap — deterministic candidate pairs
From the endpoint and target file, `Bootstrap` builds `(fromClass, fromMethod) → (toClass,
toMethod)` candidate pairs. For a Razor `.cshtml` endpoint it knows the handler lives in the
`.cshtml.cs` page model (`OnGet/OnPost…`), and it prioritises target methods that look like
entry points (`*Async`, `Build*`, `Generate*`). Up to 24 pairs.

### 2. Pre-flight — try the deterministic answer first
Before involving the model, trace runs `find_path` over those pairs. `find_path` is a **BFS
upward over callers** in Roslyn (`SymbolFinder.FindCallersAsync`) from the target until it
reaches the source — an exact shortest path. If a pair connects (the common case), the path
is printed with **zero model calls**. `--no-llm` stops here regardless.

**Brute force (`--all-paths` / `--brute` / `--deep`)**: instead of returning the first
connecting pair, it runs `find_path` over **every** candidate pair (with a wider graph
budget, 20000 nodes) and prints **all distinct paths**. For non-trivial code where one
shortest path isn't the whole picture.

### 3. The model loop — only for the hard cases
If no pair connects, the model loop runs. (Interface/DI calls *do* connect — `FindCallersAsync`
cascades through interface members to their implementations — so a real miss is a purely dynamic
link: reflection, `dynamic`, or a runtime-wired handler.) Each step the model picks one tool. The
deterministic pre-flight result is cached and used as the final answer if the model doesn't do better.

### 4. Token-level JSON enforcement
This is the core of why a small model can't break the format. Each action request sends a
flat **JSON schema** as Ollama's `format`. Ollama compiles it to a grammar and **masks
invalid tokens during sampling**, so the reply is **structurally guaranteed valid JSON** —
`Agent` parses a clean `{"tool":…,"args":{…}}` object with **no text-parsing fallback**.

The schema is deliberately **flat** (one `tool` enum + one `args` object with all optional
fields, no `anyOf`/`oneOf`, no free-text `thought` field) because small models and grammars
handle nesting and free text inside constrained JSON poorly (the latter can trigger a
repetition loop).

### 5. The schema guarantees *structure*, not *values*
A grammar can't make the values sensible — a small model may under-fill `find_path`'s args
(some models more than others). So on top of the grammar:
1. **Validate** the args make sense for the tool; if not, send a short **correction turn** and
   retry (max 2×).
2. **Loop detection**: if the model repeats an identical call, escalate within **2 steps**.
3. **Deterministic escalation**: when the model can't produce a usable call, fall back to the
   cached pre-flight `find_path`. It never runs 25 wasted iterations.

This is why the model "driving badly" is fine — Roslyn delivers the path either way.

### 6. Direct mode & rendering the path
- **`--from "C.M" --to "C2.M2"`** skips the bootstrap and runs `find_path` between the two
  concrete methods directly ("how do I get from here to there"). With **`--all-paths`** it runs
  a bounded DFS (`FindAllPaths`) that enumerates **every** distinct path — e.g. one per interface
  implementation that reaches the target, including decorator chains (DI). Interface/DI bridging
  is automatic because `FindCallersAsync` cascades through interface members to implementations.
- **`--with-bodies`** renders, between each hop, the caller's code from its start down to the
  call site of the next hop (line-numbered, clipped), with **parameter names** in signatures and
  the **argument → parameter** mapping at the call site; the **target** node shows its full body.
- **`--annotate`** adds a short LLM "why" note per hop. The annotator receives the prior steps,
  so the notes are depth-aware; trivial hops return `null` (just the code). **`--repo-url`**
  turns every `file:line` into a link.
- **`--summary`** appends a final Summary (purpose / dependencies / good-to-know) and a second,
  plain-words **"In plain words"** recap — a cheap second pass over the summary just produced.
- Every trace result then ends with a **`## Call-flow`** diagram (see below), built in `Finish`
  from the *clean* path text (before any summary prose), so it reflects only the discovered path.

The model's own `find_path` calls (inside the loop) always use the compact, no-bodies format, so
observations stay small; the rich rendering only applies to the deterministic result the user sees.

---

## The `## Call-flow` diagram — a map of what was found

Both modes finish with a deterministic, model-free diagram of the discovered flow (`Diagram.cs`),
so an engineer grasps the *shape* before reading the prose. It is rendered **two ways** at once:

- an **ASCII** block (in a ` ```text ` fence) that renders identically in any viewer — a corporate
  wiki, Notepad, an offline `.md` — so it's never a blank box on a locked-down machine;
- a **Mermaid** block (` ```mermaid `) that renders as real graphics on GitHub / VS Code.

The **entry** is tagged `◆ start`, the **target / leaf** `★ target`, and every node carries its
`file:line`. When `trace --annotate` has already produced per-hop "why" notes, the diagram
**reuses** them inline (`— …` after each node) — it never generates them itself, so the richer
chart costs no extra model calls. The layout adapts to the finding:

- a single straight path (`trace` default) → **vertical boxes** (the README look);
- a branching shape — a `trace --all-paths` fan-out (e.g. one branch per DI implementation,
  converging on the target) or an `explain` call-tree — → an **indented tree**.

How each mode feeds it:
- **explain** builds the graph straight from the explained chain (`Diagram.FromChain`); edges stay
  *within* the chain for a clean tree, and for a single method (`--depth 0`) its in-solution
  callees are shown as leaves so it isn't a lone box.
- **trace** parses the rendered path text (`Diagram.FromTraceText`) — works for every mode
  (compact, `--with-bodies`, `--all-paths`) because it reads the same numbered hops the user sees.

Both are bounded (a hard cap on rows / leaves) so a huge graph can't explode the output.

## `LlmClient` — talking to the model

- Default is **native Ollama** `POST /api/chat`, which supports both `format` (a JSON-schema
  object) and `options` (`temperature`, `num_ctx`, `num_predict`, `repeat_penalty`).
- The base URL is normalised: `http://host:11434`, `…/v1`, trailing slash — all accepted.
- **`--api-style openai`** switches to `POST /v1/chat/completions` with `response_format`
  (for LM Studio). Note: `num_ctx` can't be set over the OpenAI endpoint.
- On startup it best-effort reads `/api/version` and warns if it can't confirm Ollama ≥ 0.5
  (structured outputs need it).
- It accumulates **token usage** per call (Ollama `prompt_eval_count`/`eval_count`, OpenAI
  `usage.*_tokens`) and times each call, so the run can print a `[perf]` line.

---

## Performance — the `[perf]` line

Every run prints `[perf]` to stderr: total wall-clock, model-call count, and total **in / out**
(prompt / generated) tokens — then a **per-call breakdown** (label `[action]`/`[annotate]`/
`[summary]`/`[eli10]`/`[explain]`, duration, in/out). A deterministic run (`--no-llm`, no
`--summary`/`--annotate`) shows `0 model calls`. On CPU the bulk of the time is the model
processing/generating tokens — the Roslyn path-finding itself is fast.

---

## Tuning knobs (CPU-friendly defaults)

| knob | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--num-ctx` | 16384 | context window. 8–16K is safe with 32 GB RAM + 7B; higher risks OOM |
| `--num-predict` | 4096 | explain output cap. Action selection uses a fixed small cap (512) |
| `--temperature` | 0 / 0.2 | **0** for decisions/structure (deterministic); 0.2 for explanation prose |
| `--depth` | 1 | explain call-chain depth; `0` = fastest (just the method), higher = deeper logic |
| `--max-methods` | 8 | cap on methods explained in the chain — raise to go deeper/wider |
| `--all-paths` | off | trace: enumerate ALL paths (brute force), not just the first |
| `--with-bodies` / `--annotate` | off | trace: code between hops · per-hop LLM "why" note |
| `--summary` | off | trace: final summary + plain-words recap |
| `--from` / `--to` | — | trace: path between two concrete methods (direct mode) |
| `--no-llm` | off | trace without the model — fastest, fully deterministic |
| `-m, --model` | gemma4:latest | swap models; smaller ones are faster but may fill the trace schema worse |

Everything is bounded (tool outputs truncated, explain chain ≤ `--max-methods`, BFS node
budget capped) so a giant spaghetti codebase can't blow up context or memory.

---

## End-to-end, in one breath

`explain`: Roslyn carves out the entry method and walks the call chain down → each method is
explained on its own, then synthesised into the end-to-end logic. `trace`: Roslyn bootstraps
candidate pairs → a deterministic BFS finds the exact path(s) (usually with no model at all;
`--all-paths` enumerates every one) → the model only helps navigate the cases pure call-graph
BFS can't reach, and even then a deterministic result backs it up.
